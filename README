1. Introduction
**********************************************************************/

    TorrentFlux-NG is a multi-user download client inspired by 
    TorrentFlux B4rt
    http://www.torrentflux-ng.org/

    It includes the new RedRound theme and uses jQuery

    TorrentFlux-NG is a web based transfer control client.
    it allows you to control your torrent/http/... transfers
    from anywhere using a highly configurable web based front end.

    The full code rewrite makes TorrentFlux-NG a framework for which
    easily new transfer backends (Torrent clients, ...) can be added.

    TorrentFlux-NG is very easy to install on a web server and includes
    a simple setup script which can be accessed from a web browser.
    Just upload the files to your web server, run the setup script and
    your installation is ready to go.

    TorrentFlux-NG has builtin support for transfers via:

        o BitTorrent - supported client(s) include:

            * Original BitTorrent/Mainline - supports trackerless
              torrents and encryption

            * BitTornado - uses slightly less resources than the original
              BT, allows file priority for downloading files selectively

            * Transmission - much smaller memory footprint without much
              loss in functionality
            
            * Transmission-daemon - small memory footprint, total 
              bandwidth control, encryption, dht, magnet links, ...

            * Azureus - control a number of transfers from a single
              control process, tighter control on total max bandwidth
              for all torrents

        o HTTP/FTP - supported client(s) include:

            * wget - standard lightweight file transfer utility on
              Linux, supported on many other platforms also

        o Usenet - supported client(s) include:

            * nzbperl - perl based application allowing multi-connection
              news server downloads from nzb files with functionality
              for bandwidth throttling.


    TorrentFlux-NG incorporates a huge number of advanced options to
    allow you finer grained control of your transfers. The
    administration panel in torrentflux-b4rt includes a large number of
    options to allow you fine grained control over every aspect of your
    bittorrent/transfers usage.

    TorrentFlux-NG is also a multi-user application, allowing you to
    create individual accounts and assign restrictions to those accounts
    as you wish.
